# This workflow uses release-please to automate the release process for packages/nuxt-jsonld.
#
# 1. When a commit is pushed to master, it creates a Release PR based on Conventional Commits.
# 2. When the Release PR is merged, release-please automatically:
#    - Updates CHANGELOG.md and package.json
#    - Creates and pushes a new git tag (e.g. v1.4.1)
# 3. The npm-publish workflow is triggered by the tag creation, publishing the package to npm.
